# VirtAI Orion Virtual GPU Platform

VirtAI Orion Platform can virtualize GPUs and create GPU resource pool to:

* Aggregate physical GPUs resides on different servers (which are both difficult to manage and use!)
  * Easy to manage!
  * Easy to use!
* Create multiple virtual GPUs from a single physical GPU (provide isolation and throttling among light weighted workloads and thus improving GPU utilization)
  * Resource isolation and throttling
  * Improving GPU utilization
  * Save money!
* Turn every CPU server into GPU server
  * Access remote GPU on a CPU only server. No sweat!
* Dynamic scaling
  * Change Orion virtual GPU settings without rebooting!
